calendar.io aka ExileBot (?)

-	@racing server role, OPT-IN the bot tracks who should have the role, if we can hook events for users coming online/going offline we will 
	remove the role when they go offline, and re-apply it when they reconnect. This will avoid offline users logging back in and having a 
	bunch of mentions for races they weren't online for. However, maybe people on mobile want the offline mentions? (Have a quiet time setting?)

-	Add SQLite & things like counting commands used.
